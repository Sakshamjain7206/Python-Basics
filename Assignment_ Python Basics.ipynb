What is Python, and why is it popular?\n","\n","Ans- Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. Python is designed to be easy to understand, with a syntax that emphasizes readability and reduces the cost of program maintenance.\n","\n","Why Python is Popular:\n","\n","1. Beginner-Friendly: Python is easy-to-read syntax makes it a great choice for beginners. It allows new programmers to focus on learning programming concepts rather than syntax complexities\n","\n","2. Community Support: Python has a massive, active community that provides support, tutorials, documentation, and third-party libraries, which further accelerates development.\n","\n","3. Versatility: Python is used in diverse fields including web development, data science, automation, artificial intelligence, robotics, scientific research, and more.\n","\n","4. Data Science and Machine Learning: Python’s popularity in data science and machine learning has skyrocketed due to libraries like pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. It is considered the go-to language for many data-related tasks.\n","\n","5. Open-Source Nature: Being open-source and free to use has contributed to Python's widespread adoption in academic, research, and industrial environments.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"apv5ZezuwSqp"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["2.What is an interpreter in Python?\n","\n","Ans- An interpreter in Python is a program that executes Python code line by line. Unlike a compiler, which translates the entire source code into machine code before execution, an interpreter reads and executes the code directly, converting each line into a form the computer can execute at runtime.\n","This interpretation process is what allows Python to be cross-platform and easy to use in various environments without the need for compiling the code.\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"j8ihlrhYxWPB"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["3.What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","\n","Ans-In Python, pre-defined keywords (also called reserved words) are special words that have a specific meaning in the language and cannot be used as identifiers (such as variable names, function names, or class names). These keywords are part of the syntax and structure of the Python language.\n","\n","List of Python Keywords:\n","1. False – Boolean value indicating false.\n","2. True – Boolean value indicating true.\n","3. None – Represents the absence of a value or a null value.\n","4. and – Logical AND operator.\n","5. or – Logical OR operator.\n","6. if – Conditional statement.\n","7. else – Alternative branch for a conditional statement.\n","8. elif – Else-if, used in conditional statements.\n","9. for – Used to iterate over a sequence (like a list).\n","10. while – Used for looping as long as a condition is true.\n","11. break – Exits the current loop.\n","12. continue – Skips the current iteration of a loop and continues with the next one.\n","13. def – Defines a function.\n","14. class – Defines a class.\n","15. import – Imports a module.\n","16. from – Imports specific parts of a module.\n","17. try – Starts a try block for exception handling.\n","18. except – Defines a block to handle exceptions.\n","19. finally – Defines a block that executes after the try-except blocks, regardless of exceptions."],"metadata":{"id":"8bPaoMmHxzlG"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["4.Can keywords be used as variable names?\n","\n","Ans-No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python. Keywords are reserved by the Python language for specific syntactical purposes, so using them as variable names would result in a syntax error."],"metadata":{"id":"2MIjvXj0ytTl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["5.What is mutability in Python?\n","\n","Ans- Mutability in Python refers to the ability of an object to be modified after it is created. In other words, a mutable object’s state or value can be changed, whereas an immutable object cannot be altered once it is assigned."],"metadata":{"id":"636WRWeEy7zz"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["6.Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","\n","Ans-Lists are mutable in Python because they are designed for dynamic collections that can change (adding/removing elements). Tuples are immutable to provide data integrity and efficiency, ensuring fixed data that cannot be modified. This immutability makes tuples suitable for use as dictionary keys and ensures faster access and memory efficiency."],"metadata":{"id":"Y5Myj40mzOcK"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["7.What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n","\n","Ans-= checks value equality, while is checks object identity (whether two variables point to the same object in memory)."],"metadata":{"id":"L1oC1FokzlUk"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["8. What are logical operators in Python?\n","\n","Ans-Logical operators in Python are used to combine or manipulate Boolean values (True or False) and to evaluate expressions in logical conditions. The primary logical operators in Python are:\n","\n","1. And = Returns True if both conditions are true.\n","2. Or  = Returns True if at least one of the conditions is true.\n","3. Not = Reverses the Boolean value of the condition. If the condition is True, it returns False, and vice versa.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"1SlpPc6b0GDZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["9.What is type casting in Python?\n","\n","Ans-Type casting in Python refers to the process of converting one data type to another. Python provides built-in functions to explicitly convert between different types.\n","\n","There are two types of type casting are:\n","1. implicit\n","2. excplicit\n","\n","Type Casting Functions:\n","1. int(): Converts a value to an integer.\n","2. float(): Converts a value to a float.\n","3. str(): Converts a value to a string.\n","4. list(): Converts a value to a list (from a tuple, set, etc.).\n","5. tuple(): Converts a value to a tuple (from a list, set, etc.).\n","6. bool(): Converts a value to a boolean (True or False).\n"],"metadata":{"id":"KRufANv50msm"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["10.What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","\n","Ans- The difference between implicit and explicit type casting in Python lies in how the conversion of data types is performed and who initiates it.\n","\n","1. Implicit Type Casting (Automatic)\n","Definition: In implicit type casting, Python automatically converts a smaller data type to a larger one, usually when there is no risk of losing information or precision.\n","2. Explicit Type Casting (Manual)\n","Definition: In explicit type casting, the programmer manually converts one data type to another using built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), etc."],"metadata":{"id":"OJTnrysO1kxt"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["11.What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","\n","Ans- The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to allow the program to make decisions and execute specific blocks of code based on certain conditions. They enable the program to respond differently depending on whether a condition is True or False, thus controlling the flow of execution.\n","\n","Types of Conditional Statements in Python:\n","1. if statement: Executes a block of code if the condition is True.\n","2. elif statement (short for \"else if\"):Checks additional conditions if the previous if conditions are False.\n","3. else statement:Executes a block of code if all preceding if/elif conditions are False."],"metadata":{"id":"3rjV0vQr18bB"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["12.How does the elif statement work?\n","\n","Ans-The elif (short for \"else if\") statement in Python is used to check multiple conditions sequentially after an initial if statement. It allows you to test several conditions in a chain, executing a block of code as soon as one of those conditions is True. If none of the conditions are true, the else block (if provided) will execute.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"tjgpPrSL2mvI"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["13.What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","\n","Ans-The for and while loops in Python are both used for iteration, but they differ in how they control the loop’s execution.\n","\n","1. for Loop\n","Definition: A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range). It repeats the block of code for each item in the sequence.\n","2. while Loop\n","Definition: A while loop repeats a block of code as long as a given condition evaluates to True. It continues running until the condition becomes False.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"RXUYl6Ka2129"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["14.Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop?\n","\n","Ans-A while loop is more suitable than a for loop when the number of iterations is not known in advance and you need to continue looping until a specific condition is met, which might depend on dynamic factors.\n","\n","**Example Scenario: User Input Validation**\n","Imagine a scenario where you want to repeatedly prompt the user to enter a valid password until they enter one that meets certain criteria (e.g., at least 8 characters, contains both letters and numbers).
